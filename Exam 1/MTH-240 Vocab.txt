MTH-240 Vocab:
Consistent {
A linear system with at least one solution.
}
Inconsistent:
Basic Variable {
A variable in a linear system that corresponds to a pivot column in the coefficient matrix.
}
Free Variable {
Any variable in a linear system that is not a basic variable.
}
Augmented Matrix {
A matrix made up of a coefficient matrix for a linear system and one or more columns to the right. Each extra column contains the constants from the right side of a system with the given coefficient matrix.
}
Coefeccient Matrix {
(matrix of coefficients) A matrix whose entries are the coefficients of a system of linear equations.
}
Trivial Solution {
The solution x = 0 of a homogeneous equation Ax=0.
}
Nontrivial Solution {
A nonzero solution of a homogeneous equation or system of homogeneous equations.
}
Linearly Independent {
An indexed set  with the property that the vector equation has only the trivial solution. 
}
Linearly Dependent {
An indexed set  with the property that there exist weights not all zero, such that. That is, the vector equation has a nontrivial has a nontrivia solution.
}
Foward Phase {
(of row reduction) The first part of the algorithm that reduces a matrix to echelon form.
}
Linear Combination { 
A sum of scalar multiples of vectors. The scalars are called the

(mapping) A mapping such that each in is the image of at most is the image of at most is the image of at most one X in R^n.
}
Onto/Surjective {
(mapping) A mapping such that each in is the image of at least is the image of at least is the image of at least one X in R^n.
